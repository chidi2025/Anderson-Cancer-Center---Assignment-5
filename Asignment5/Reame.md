## Assignment 1: Netflix Data Analysis

### Tasks

1. Data Preparation: Unzip the dataset and rename it to "Netflix_shows_movies."
2. Data Cleaning: Address missing values in the dataset.
3. Data Exploration: Perform various data exploration tasks, including describing the data and conducting statistical analysis.
4. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the most watched genres and the distribution of ratings using Python libraries (Seaborn, Pyplot, and Matplotlib).
5. R Integration: Implement one of the charts or visualizations in R.

### Instructions

- Execute the provided Python code in Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
- Ensure the required libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) are installed.
- For R Integration, use the `reticulate` library to export visualizations.

## Assignment 2: Anderson Cancer Center PCA

### Tasks

1. PCA Implementation: Utilize PCA to demonstrate how essential variables can be acquired from the cancer dataset available from sklearn.datasets.
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the dataset into 2 PCA components for the project.
3. Bonus Point (Optional): Implement logistic regression for prediction.

### Instructions

- Run the Python script in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment.
- Include the provided logistic regression code for bonus points.
- Ensure required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed.

## Bonus Assignment: Logistic Regression

### Tasks

- Optionally, implement logistic regression for prediction to earn bonus points.
- Submit your work as a zipped file or a link to your GitHub repository. Include a README file with comprehensive instructions.

### Instructions

- Execute the provided Python script for logistic regression.
- Ensure required libraries (scikit-learn) are installed.
